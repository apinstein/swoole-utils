# swoole-utils

A collection of utilities for building concurrent applications with Swoole.

## Background

These libraries were developed during efforts to build a large concurrent system with PHP + Swoole. 

There are many great patterns in Go that I found not fully ported to Swoole, so I have tried to fill some gaps.
